# ESG-Event-Driven-Risk

**Predicting Financial Impact from ESG Events Using Alternative Data**

---

## Overview

**ESG-Event-Driven-Risk** is a research-focused project that extracts ESG-related events from company disclosures and reports, and models their potential impact on financial metrics such as stock prices and credit spreads. Inspired by Bloomberg Intelligence's ESG Event-Driven Risk methodology, this pipeline demonstrates how environmental, social, and governance incidents can translate into measurable financial risk.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion:** Extracts raw data from ESG reports, PDFs, and structured disclosures.
- **Data Processing:** Cleans, tokenizes, and encodes ESG event data for downstream analysis.
- **Alternative Data Modeling:** Uses NLP models (e.g., LLaMA variants) to analyze ESG content.
- **Risk Prediction:** Estimates potential market impact, including changes in stock volatility and credit spreads.
- **Local Execution:** Designed to run entirely on a local machine (M1 Pro / 16GB RAM) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA).

## Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**
   - Input: ESG reports, regulatory filings, sustainability disclosures.
   - Optional: Additional structured data such as ESG scores.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Convert PDFs to text.
   - Clean and normalize financial and ESG-related content.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Identify ESG events, keywords, and risk-relevant metrics.
   - Encode text for model input using tokenizers compatible with LLaMA or similar models.

4. **Modeling**
   - Fine-tune a parameter-efficient LLaMA variant (e.g., 3B or 7B) using LoRA.
   - Predict impact of ESG events on financial outcomes such as:
     - Stock price movement
     - Credit spread changes
     - Risk rating adjustments

5. **Output**
   - Risk impact scores per event.
   - Aggregate risk indicators for companies and sectors.
