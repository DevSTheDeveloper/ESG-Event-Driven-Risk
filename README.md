# ESG-Event-Driven-Risk

**Event-driven modeling of financial risk from ESG incidents**

This project applies machine learning and event-study methodology to quantify the financial impact of ESG-related events. Using [`finbert-esg-9-categories`](https://huggingface.co/yiyanghkust/finbert-esg-9-categories), company disclosures and sustainability reports are classified into nine ESG event categories (e.g., climate change, human capital, governance). Each detected incident is then linked to market data: we pull **minute-level ticker prices from Yahoo Finance**, constructing an event window spanning the day before through the day after the disclosure.

By combining **ESG NLP classification** with **short-horizon abnormal return analysis**, the pipeline measures how specific ESG shocks translate into price reactions and volatility shifts. The framework demonstrates how unstructured disclosures can be systematically converted into structured risk signalsâ€”bridging natural language processing with financial time series analysis for practical ESG risk modeling.
